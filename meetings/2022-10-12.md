## Topics

* SC: This meeting follows https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/458 .
* SC: Today's agenda is intended to help us (re)align a bit as a group.
* SC: Please note that unless there is a decision to change the meeting datetime, it is always on UTC time (and daylight savings time is not observed as it stands).


### Topics of Interest

* SC: The CG weekly meeting will take up topics that are generally of interest to multiple or between contributors.
* SC: Such as announcements, process, guidelines, feedback, as well as all Work Items.
* SC: We are mindful of the available time. Deep and detailed discussions are encouraged to continue elsewhere.



### Panels, Task Forces, and Getting Stuff Done

* SC: We've discussed the state of Panels as well as considerations on forming Task Forces to carry out specific assignments provided that there is commitment, e.g., https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/458 (and links from there).
* SC: Minor case in point: https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/ initially formed with a group to address a specific need. Similar initiatives could also work out with small or informal charters.
* SC: Any brief additional feedback on this topic?



### Expected Completion of Work Items
URL: https://solidproject.org/TR/

* SC: The Expected Completion column for the Work Items is updated to reflect information in Charters and based on Current Stage of the Work Item.
* SC: I'd like to once again ask the contributors of the Work Items to either submit PRs to update the table columns. It should take into account of the goals of the Work Item, as well as test coverage, implementation reports, "adequate implementation experience" and so on.



### Contribution Guidelines
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

* SC: All feedback and improvements welcome.
* SC: On a related note, are things and activities of interest findable? How can we improve?



### Current and Former Editors of Work Items

* SC: Revisit Work Items to see what needs updating. Here is one:

#### Update authorization-ucr's editors
URL: https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/309

* SC: This is a Call for Editors for authorization-ucr.
* SC: The document can advance to TR/ if there is commitment from editors. Needs a serious update.
* SC: Please follow-up on the issue.



### Quality Assurance

* SC: As the Work Items progress, we need to ensure QA.
* SC: Synchronizing QA activities with specification milestones.
* SC: Using the Test Suite Panel Charter as start: https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/test-suite-panel-charter.md
  >operate with a mutual understanding between contributors to technical reports, test suite software maintainers, and software implementers by following a cooperation process
* SC: Please familiarise yourself with the aims there as that will be integral to how we communicate level of adoption.
* SC: See also https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/402 and https://github.com/solid/test-suite-panel/ .
* SC: Defining the QA process is one of the things we need to do.
