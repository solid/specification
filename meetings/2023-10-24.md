## Topics

### Authentication problems to resolve
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-oidc/issues/221

* SC: RH can summarise and go from there..
* RH: focus on one topic
* ...: screen share with slides
* ...: recap of Solid-OIDC
* ...: 2 phases: (a) app contacts issuer via browser; app announces itself and hash of PKCE

... RH encountered network errors ...

* eP: newer OIDC library in CSS uses the `iss` parameter by default; some problems with the `solid-client-authn-js` client in handling that parameter; possibly some confusion about it

... RH returned ...

* RH: there are attack vectors for exfiltrating these tokens
* ...: There are various incarnations of OpenID Connect
* ...: Is the model chosen by Solid-OIDC susceptible to this?
* ...: Because this RFC exists, there is a compelling case for adopting this RFC
* ...: There are concerns about this
* ...: There is a trivial way to manipulate the PKCE
* AC: Can you point to any materials online which are talking about this? I understand that you are talking about reversing the hash, which is not trival. Especially in the time available in the oauth flow.
* RH: It is well assumed that we are not going be able to reverse the hash
* ...: One can trick the honest party into giving the tricker the reverse of the hash in the 3rd step of the protocol
* ...: The response code should be sent to the honest issuer; when tricked, they will send it to the attacker.
* AC: How do you just trick a client into sending their crypto material? I understand that you say client can be tricked to send the cypto material, not to the endpoint of legitimate issuer but to some other endpoint.
* ...: the 9207 is specific for OAuth2; the client has to be configured; I see how this can work for OAuth2. In OIDC, one provides the issuer, and from there, the endpoints are discovered. Are you able to trick the issuer into returning wrong response, or is the client just so poorly implemented?
* RH: How easy is it to have one WebID used across many issuers?
* AC: You can have one WebID with multiple issuers.
* AC: Let's look at WebID, which asserts trust to issuer 1 and issuer 2. Each of these advertises token endpoints on coresopnding URLs.
* RH: You have these two issuers; one of them you control and ensure all the security checks. There is another issuer on the ecosystem; how do you ensure the same level of security? There might be all sorts of problems there. You don't assume that everyone is of the same level of trust in the system.
* eP: AC, were you referring to oidc server metadata advertising the token endpoint?
* RH: In analysis, we often simplify and take the best and the worst cases. All issuers should not assume that all other issuers are honest.
* AC: As I understand, if one has 2 issuers, one trustworthy and the other malicious... If you send authentication information to the bad issuer(s), bad things can happen.
* RH: It goes a step further, one contacts malicious app which in turn uses the honest issuer pretending to be app. This allows compromise of an honest issuer by contacting a malicious issuer.
* SL: OIDC defers some questions of trust to the browser security model. It relies on the browser sandbox for some assurances. WebID assumes that person controls access to their profile document and it can be trusted. If care can be ensured, some risks are addressed.
* eP: If someone adds a malicious issuer to a WebID document, unless the AS or RS has some restriction, then it doesn't matter that you can compromise the honest issuer — the malicious issuer can exploit user data regardless. 
* RH: Apps will trust one issuer (A), but not another trusted issuer (B); this allows you to log in with the Google issuer, pretending to log in with the other issuer.
* SL: In OIDC we have RP, OP, and RS. From experience in working with RS, a trust relationship is required with an issuer to interact with data. I still fail to see how a token could be exfiltrated. We should separate PKCE and WebID.
* RH: There is a fundamental relationship between PKCE and WebID; we should talk about the layers independently.
* eP: In the issue in Solid-OIDC, there were three points. (WAC is out of scope.) Can we treat the other two separately?
* RH: So far, we have only discussed the first one (`iss` parameter) but alluded to the third point (PKCE)
* ...: regardless of the threat model, if this is simple to implement, then why not?
* RH: The mix-up is caused by authorization coming back without indicating the issuer. This can be mitigated by indicating the issuer in the auth code response.
* eP: There are two informative papers in the RFC https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207.html#name-introduction
* RH: by Daniel Fett
* eP: I think mandating it could at least prevent some interop issues which I noticed in CSS and Inrupt's JS client repos.
* AC: From the OIDC perspective, I don't see advantages. I implemented OPs, RPs, RSs. I see why it would work for OAuth2; I don't see it needed for OIDC.
* SL: The way I understand it, we are talking about vulnerability introduced by the RP (client) weakness.
* RH: This is only one attack vector, with regard to malicious issuer being excluded by the RS.
* SL: With 9207, we add MUST for `iss` query parameter on the OP and client.
* AC: When you get that indication, you know precisely where that should go next. I don't see a downside but I'm not convinced that it is as much of the issue.
* RH: My understanding is that from implementation perspective it can help implementation.
* ...: I could try to put some notes for the attack vectors. My slides didn't work with jitsi.
* ...: If we scale up the ecosystem, there will be more and more manipulation. If we can plug attack vector with simple fix, it will not hurt.
* eP: We could try the screen share again to see the slides.
* RH: showing slides again
* AC: This is helpful, thank you
* SL: ...
* AC: DPoP is now IETF RFC. It provides a way to bind the initial authorization step to the DPoP key used by the client. Issuer parameter coming from the issuer would be an ultimate step to resolving it.
* RH: This is probably also simpler than other ways of solving it. It also solves cross-site forgery attack. 
* eP: Two remarks — first, we can proceed with a Pull Request, with terms of either SHOULD or MUST. (At least SHOULD; we can discuss further in issue.) Second, the client is an honest agent; why would the client choose the malicious IdP?
* SL: The use case where an honest RP asks the user for an Issuer is a known user experience journey — there are multiple ways a user could end up on the malicious OP.
* eP: This is especially an issue if the RS doesn't trust the malicious IdP
* AC: It seems that there is more to discuss, should we try to schedule another session like this?
* TT: It shows 2h call on my calendar
* AC: I can't continue today
* RH: Maybe also to much for energy level.

ACTION: eP: request another slot during CG meeting

* SL: This has been great, thank you!
