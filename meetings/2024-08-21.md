* Sarven Capadisli


### Introductions
* RZ: Post-doc at Oxford Univ. Working on ethical web and data architectures. Read about Solid quite a few years ago. I was invited last time by eP for work on Data Terms of Use. Related to authorization and access control in Solid. Here I am. \o/

## Topics

### Solid Community AU follow-up

* VB: STM to follow up on specific topics on August 27th or September 3rd (12:00 UTC).
* VB: Related to encryption and authorization.
* eP: Discovery.
* SC: Message payload being encrypted? Storage encryption?
* eP: I understood it as resource being encrypted.

### Rui Zhao's work

* eP: invited Rui to present his work
  * paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645631
  * draft: https://renyuneyun.github.io/solid-dtou/dtou-spec.html
  * mentioned in https://github.com/solid/security-considerations/issues/12#issuecomment-2191897863
* RZ: slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ax7Vjo0FkmguhhnHRbhj_iQ5ivQzZjs_urqHhixqu1o/edit
* RZ: We don't like the "biggest lie on the Internet" but their contents are important.
* RZ: Are we at a better position in Solid? Actually no. Problems are more serious. We expect more apps; user to make decision on data usage (autonomy). DToU may be a way out.
* RZ: DTOU research targets: encoding user preferences (for data usage) and/or apps promises/behaviours (of data usage); supporting interoperability in decentralized context; check compliance and/or other policy semantics (e.g., obligations); support continuous policy checking.
* RZ: Perennial.
* RZ: Users encode data policy and associate with documents; app policy to be sent by the app to Solid service; protocol to perform reasoning tasks and facilitate use.
* RZ: Some advantages (compare to normal access control) to for users and apps. 
* RZ: There are policy sets. We want to how input data/policy should generate output.
* RZ: Needs policy authoring — user needs to be able to write data policies with helper tools, users need to write access rules, apps need to write app policies. Needs to go beyond document/container-level policy.
* RZ: Need some helpers: ML/NLP/LLMe, e.g., privacy policy to app policy, user behaviour observation agent. Better semantic coverage (unifying tags, extended activation condition, time constraints). Align with, e.g., ODRL. Establish "contract", provenance, and auditing tools.
* eP: I've read your paper. You also have the spec but haven't read yet. Seems comprehensive.
* eP: Are you familiar with some existing efforts? — noting SC's mentions
* eP: https://tosdr.org/
* RZ: Right, found that in the early days of the work. I wasn't focusing on that, because that was still relying on natural language policies (c. 2018/2019). The only way is to use formal encodings, and that's where my research is heading.
* eP: Goals are similar although tech is different. I understand that you worked with Solid Labs? And also UMA?
* RZ: I've talked with Blake (???) last year.
* eP: I think they prepared a demo for the Solid Symposium 2024. See also https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/user-managed-access/ and https://github.com/woutslabbinck/ucp-enforcement
* eP: Now to the question. I really like "data owner" of resource policies. For my current understanding, I find it similar to how we do it in SAI. We have policies on the resource, different access/data grants, and access needs. I think it is more basic and no reasoning. There are different sides matching those. I think this is really important. I haven't seen much in Solid — SC had an example (see below).
* eP: In SAI, there is an org that owns data, and gives access to members, and then I want to access it with application. If, say, Solid CG gives me access, then I can give access to the app. Have you worked with delegations?
* RZ: What is possible at the moment is because data/app policy describing what criteria needs to be satisfying. Not particular to a data consumer. If possible for all these people to have the same criteria, we can set one. But if we need different policies for different persons, then that is not covered.
* eP: If I think about access control, for different agents, there are different permissions. Is there equivalent?
* RZ: ??? Roughly equivalen to Role-BAC.
* SC: Thanks for the presentation. Good to see your work reached some of the same conclusions that we have in Solid. 
* SC: Some prior work (e.g., using ODRL/DPV) in Solid (2019) related to the things mentioned in the presentation:
  * [ODRL in Solid](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/55)
  * [Implementation of an application — dokieli — making use of user's preferred policy against a storage's policy](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355#issuecomment-1140508784) — Open digital rights contrasting [storage description and personal policies](https://dokie.li/media/video/dokieli-odrl-storage-description.webm), [agreements and actions between people](https://dokie.li/media/video/dokieli-odrl.webm).
  * [Expressing preferred policies or templates](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/21)
  * [Expressing preferred policies or templates](https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/36)
  * [Discovery of an ODRL resource](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/12)
  * [Towards an authorization framework for the Solid ecosystem](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/121)
* RZ: Thanks. I know some of those resources but not all. Speaking of ODRL, I do collaborate with Beatriz. She has a background in ODRL, access control in Solid.
* SC: BE presented their work at some point in Solid CG on that.
* eP: How are we following up on that? I understand that it is not Solid specific. Compare different UCs? 
* SC: I'm interested in understanding the standards gap. Which are not addressing the use cases. Minor example: when I was doing the implementation above, the gap was how to express the idea that I prefer these policies. If we can break down the parts of the use cases or requirements, we can identify the extent to which the standards are covering those things, and which things we need to add. ODRL and DPV are in separate community groups. I presume they cover a lot of the considerations, and Solid did quite a bit of work too. Are there specific things when mixing and matching these that are not covered? Then that needs an issue. 
* RZ: I think a lot of things are missing. Speaking of how to move forward: what additional things we need. What I'd imagine is write down a few use cases with current access control mechanisms.
* SC: Wrt to authorization, we have: https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/
* SC: Need to check assumptions all around re use cases and the solutions.
