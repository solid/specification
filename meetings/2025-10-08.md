### Demo: mallory toolkit

https://elf-pavlik.github.io/mallory/rimraf/

* eP: Very early seed of a toolkit to prototype malicious Solid apps and demonstrate well known vulnerabilities. Link after the demo
* eP: MdJ demo of ACP app permissioning https://youtu.be/5Q1nUmGdaXE

* LD: Auth screen can communicate risks better. Server responding to that request should protect user. It should take a negative look at what could be bad about it. If you don't want them to do that, create another pod.
* eP: Next week I can show https://sai.js.org auth screen. A very early wireframe is also available in https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/primer/authorization-agent.html#gathering-authorizations
