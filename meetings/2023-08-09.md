## Topics

URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/7

### Motivation still seems a bit vague
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/44

### Clarifying "Achieve Them" in Deliverables Section
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/45


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.
* SC: More on the future of this topic in [Solid Demos](#Solid-Demos) and other dedicated meetings.


### Solid Demos
* SC: Following https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-07-19.md#solid-demos
* SC: There is a "Call for Group updates and Technical Demos (videos)" at TPAC2023. It is suggested that we showcase the work done in the Solid CG by creating a short video to be published on the TPAC2023 website. Videos are due by 2023-08-30. More details to follow, but there are [Best Practices for Recording Videos](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2023/Demos_and_Group_updates#Best_Practices_for_Recording_Videos).
* SC: We have two separate cases to communicate/demo: 1) general CG work, and 2) specific use cases or interests.
* SC: For the time being, I suggest everyone self-publish their screencasts, and share the URLs with the CG. These are good assets. We can find a home to refer to those links. More details to follow; for instance, make sure the URL is publicly archivable by the Internet Archive.


### Add W3C Solid CG Charter
URL: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323

* SC: Thank you to everyone approving and making improvements to the charter.
* SC: Effective on 2023-09-01. Pending licensing section (see next topic).

#### MIT License and/or W3C CLA and FSA
URL: https://github.com/solid/process/issues/327

* SC: A summary:
* SC: The temporary resolution in [2023-08-02 CG meeting](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-08-02.md#mit-license-andor-w3c-cla-and-fsa) was to mention both MIT+W3C licenses in the charter, and to incorporate the resolution of [issue 327](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/327) by 2023-08-31. There is no specific objection to using both MIT and W3C licenses.
* SC: There are two change suggestions (let's call them the "short" and "long" version):
  * Short: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323#discussion_r1282179722
  * Long: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323#discussion_r1285660875
* SC: The short version is closest to 2023-08-02 meeting resolution, and the longer version incorporates finer details of W3C requirements as well as recommendations for the ecosystem. We can commit one of these change suggestions now, and keep the PR open as previously agreed.

PROPOSAL: Merge the short version? (If long version is preferred, say so along with +0)

PROPOSAL: Merge the long version?

* SC: There is a request to have more (undefined amount of) time given so that a particular participant can review legal implications with respect to change in the contract of their contributions.
* SC: We can still benefit from Rigo's advisory but they're out of office. TimBL is "out of office" as well.
* SC: Corrections or additional information is welcome! So are objections - please provide details / follow-up on issue 327.
* SC: *opens floor*

### Return ETag headers on PUT requests
https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues/632

* SC: Let's have additional eyes/minds on this. Cases in which the ETag header can(not) be used in `PUT` and `PATCH` responses. Potentially introduce a requirement or add advisory in Solid Protocol.
