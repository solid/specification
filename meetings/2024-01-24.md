### CG Call Frequency
* MdJ: We could consider having fewer and lighter plenary CG calls, in favour of more in-depth work meetings on specific work items, and moving spec PR reviews into either async for small ones or STMs for bigger ones (then also requiring the STM to write its conclusions into the issue it was about).
