### solid catalog - plans for self publishing

https://github.com/solid/catalog/issues/4#issuecomment-2994170980

* eP: ...
* JZ: sharing screen
* JZ: this is current version of catalog, my and Pavlik's goals are very different. I worked on it for 5 years and gathered hundreds of records. What I designed is meant to be public facing catalog intended for people not familiar with solid to get involved. Find resources, help with app development, information on technical resources. 
* JZ: Very important part is categorization and presentation of categories, it is an ongoing process and changes based on user's feedback. I think it is premature for most parts to talk about self publishing. Some of technical resources that Pavlik is working on, are close to be ready for self publishing. On the other hand learning resources, communication channels etc. Those don't have existing descriptions and we don't have a way to pull that information out. There is a number of issues with organizations and people. We can say that they have WebID and we can just scrape that. People may want to have different things in their WebID profile and in solid catalog profile. I don't think we will ever get to the point where everyone has capability to do that. I think we need  central catalog with forms. We can also eventually accomodate pulling in the data from other sources. I don't think shapes are ready, especially in the form of categorization. If we look at existing classes, we don't get any further categorization of that. We have keyword system as well to gather input for the future.
* JZ: I'm in favor of eventual self-publishing effort, not in favor to jump directly into that. 
* JZ: Another difference is in using SKOS categories, Pavlik takes a position that those are catalog specific and we shouldn't have it as part of our shapes. If the idea is to self publish without paying attention to categorization I'm opposed for that.
* JZ: I proposed that we can have submission process where categories can be added. I don't agree to dump data into catalog without categorizing it. Categorization can help with drawing in users.
* eP: ...
* EB: Where is the RDF data?
* eP: https://github.com/solid/catalog/blob/main/catalog-data.ttl
* JZ: For some kinds of resources categories can be added afterwards. For example for apps people should be able to add categories by themself. I think this should be part of shapes. Here is published skos taxonomy, public can say it makes sense or not, app providers can say if it describes their apps or not.
