## Topics

* SC: Lacking quorum, we had a wide ranging conversation that included a number of Solid-related and Solid-tangential topics. Much food for thought, but not easily captured for minutes.
* SC: Only the topic on milestone 0.11.0 was taken up from the original agenda while acknowledging open PRs related to milestone 0.10.0.
