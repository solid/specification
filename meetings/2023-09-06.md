### W3C Solid Community Group and WebAgents Community Group Joint Meeting
URL: https://hackmd.io/ftVbmvj0R0Oh6EsPWTEkwQ

* SC: On 2023-09-26. Topics proposals welcome.


### Solid CG Charter
URL: https://github.com/solid/process/pull/323

* SC: CG approved in [2023-08-30 CG meeting](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-08-30.md#solid-wg-char). Minor delay on dotting the i's and crossing the t's: Legal and Vision checks. Still effective 2023-09-01. Amendments can follow.
* SC:
  * Solid vision: [requested review from TimBL](https://matrix.to/#/!QxZtVBYQfMeMTnespj:gitter.im/$PV_1sBrd6HFM2BpFt1V3DoLtvyOy02OVP-D0Vq9zAOk).
  * Legal check: [requested review from RW](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/7916591d1ffdc4cfae7cf2c8a11772c198ae7db0/solid-cg-charter.md#license).
* SC: If there are no rights or licensing incompatibilities or patent policy complications for the CG or the proposed WG, the PR can be merged (including any editorial clarifications) and resolving [MIT License and/or W3C CLA and FSA](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/327).
* SC: Any other changes to the CG charter will follow the "Amendments to this Charter" process.
* SC: Relatively minor follow up: I am looking into latest published version URL. Admin stuff: Publishing at w3.org entails copying CG charter into a WordPress page available from the [W3C Solid CG homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/). Roughly half of the CGs with a charter use w3.org and the other half uses github.io. 
* SC: Other follow-ups: Contributing Guide.


### Horizontal and Wide Reviews for Technical Reports
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/256

* SC: Recommend making an explicit request to TAG to review the Solid Protocol.
* SC: Will write a short explainer. I'll share a draft in chats for quick review.
* SC: Should review tests, test suite.. including the reference work items. I can't stress enough how important [Solid QA](https://solidproject.org/ED/qa) is whether in CG or WG. Would people like to be more familiar with Solid QA in a Special Topic Meeting?


### Braid
URL: https://github.com/braid-org/braid-spec

* SC: ?


### Solid Protocol Version 0.11.0
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/7

* SC: Let's make sure to add any missing issues/PRs that can reasonably make it into this release. The ED includes class 3 and higher changes, and some in the pipeline. See [Solid Protocol ED Changelog](https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol#changelog).


### Tracking specs changing to use RFC 911x
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/471#issuecomment-1685201553

* SC: Thinking that ED specs can update refs independently.
* SC: Re https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-08-30.md#tracking-specs-changing-to-use-rfc-911x
>* WT: Notifications protocol refers to a different version as the Solid protocol because the other updated specs do not use the reference on the normative section. 
* SC: I'd like a clarification on the quoted as the minutes is not detailed enough.


#### Feat: update HTTP refs in protocol
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/561

>* SC: Seems okay to merge (with potential minor tweaks) but I'd suggest to gather more feedback.
* SC: We messaged in CSS/NSS/app-dev chats already. PR open 2 weeks. Let's go.
