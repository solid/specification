## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback

* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### W3C Solid WG Charter Proposal

#### clarify scope
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/62

#### clarify the handling of low-maturity normative references
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/63


### Special Topic Meetings
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/555

* SC: Joint meeting with Social CG. Tuesday (some preference for this) or Friday 16:00 UTC okay? 


### Solid CG Chair Election Procedure
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/582

* SC: https://github.com/virginiaBalseiro/solid-ecosystem-monitor/ now includes code using W3C API (see `node-w3capi` directory) towards helping with the election process, in particular determining eligible voters. This data will be passed to W3C Staff for the questionnaire/verifying results.
* SC: There is the possibility that some organisations may not respond to the call on having one representative for putting their ballot, and more than one participant with the same affiliation may vote. To work around this, simple solution: take the vote from the participant that has their name earlier in alphabetical order.


### Add section on decisions and processing-pull-requests
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/590

* SC: Further details decisions and processing PRs based on https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/#correction-classes


### Align shared core terminology
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/557

* SC: The discussion served its purpose (but we can improve as suggested by Ted). We should considering convert this to issues and/or PRs. And try to cover them for the next releases of the specs.


### i18n and n11n of resource identifiers
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/575

* SC: All, please review.
* SC: Didn't get a chance to review but very interested in us getting this (in one shape or another) into 0.11.0.


### Please review CG Report requirements
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/587

* SC: Concerns releasing CG-DRAFT/FINALs.
* SC: See also next topic re Solid Protocol v0.11.0


### Solid Protocol Version 0.11.0
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/7

* SC: Let's make sure to add any missing issues/PRs that can reasonably make it into this release. The ED includes class 3 and higher changes, and some in the pipeline. See [Solid Protocol ED Changelog](https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol#changelog).
* SC: Unless there is new information to discuss, I suggest we keep this topic short and only for awareness.
