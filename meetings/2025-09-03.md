### Tracking obstacles

We can keep better track of the obstacles participants are facing in achieving their goals. How CG and broader Solid community can help with overcoming them.

eP: For instance, functionality someone needs in CSS or in the test harness.

MdJ: Yes, for instance also, when someone asks a question on Matrix, in general we get good replies and pointers.

Matthias: I managed to process read process, now working on write. It feels like the puzzle where pieces are falling into places. I'm diving into Noel's code, and following open source approach.

### Use cases and requirements

* Coordinating with WG
* Capturing ones like brought up by Fred for Trinpod

### Reconnecting with communities

Maybe Practictioners could lead it

* https://solidlab.be/
* https://solidcommunity.au/

PAC: Scope of Solid CG is pretty broad and it might be hard to track. There are break out sessions around TPAC and in spring. CGs may discuss and open what they do for broader audience. Also open our group and make joined sessions. PAC will be there in person.

### Scribing

Can we keep trying to automate it? More CGs need it, worth finding out what hapened to the [modern tooling](https://w3c.github.io/modern-tooling/) effort.

* TallTed: Credentials CG has embraced GoogleMeet and some autotranscriber therein. It's still not perfect, but it's better than many humans, and far better than bot transcription was <strike>a year</strike> a few months ago.

MdJ: I don't think scribing is enough of a reason to move away from open source tooling.


## Actions

ACTION: eP to add Solid World to CG calendar
ACTION: Tom to prepare agenda topic about access control models and law
