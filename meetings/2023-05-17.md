### Clarify normative, tentative, new Deliverables
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/28

>* PA: Yes, I will review this PR and try to get feedback from other W3C people about how to address this. I like the idea to list them as other "adopted" drafts; however, this might indicate a stronger commitment.

* SC: PR open for one month. We discussed and factored in changed. The PR is still a significant improvement. I propose we merge now prior to other reviews from W3C. PA / W3C Team can follow-up when new information is available.
