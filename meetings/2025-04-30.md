### Code of Conduct followup

* RG: I shall record my statement. As a free person, I believe I have the right to choose the method or platform to discuss technical issues with the community, the same as anyone else. For this reasons, I find the language used by the chair in #724 in closing the issue to be completely a misuse of their authority. The chairs have demonstrated reluctuance to understand and apply the specific provisions as laid out in documents such as in the [PWE W3C CoC](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct) as [publicly advised](https://matrix.to/#/!QxZtVBYQfMeMTnespj:gitter.im/$vqBKTkAsYprBae5R0z2rrjM3r6HeucADaqUtdXfeRO4) by the previous Solid CG chair. 
* RG: This is the Solid project, a project meant to create freedoms for the internet end user. And because charity begins at home, I shall be politely declining "the invitation" to surrender my freedom and agency (by opening a GitHub Discussion in lieu of an Issue) to the tyranny of an arbitrary rule made up by the chairs on the back of a frivilous complaint without due process. I shall not be participating in these meetings until such time as the chair stop engaging in the [fallacy of balance](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy). I reserve my right for further action.
* HZ: We had conversation with W3C. I don't think it is as bad as it sounds. There is an aspect of a recurring behavior from few members of the community.
* eP: we are still working on it. We'll try to take measures to minimise unnecessary tensions.
* HZ: Solid CG spreads across few organizations and uses various channels. Some channels are not directly related to W3C and the spec. On those channels it is not clear who has authority over them.
* AB: I don't think all this discussion should be public. Instead direct and private, only report publically when someone gets banned or their access is revoked.
* HZ: I agree, there was also request for transparency so we may share more details. Discussing technical issues in public and personal issues in private.
* AB: I think this is mostly work that should be done by ODI.
* eP: we we'll ask W3C what could be made public and what should stay private.
* eP: There is CG, WG, ODI, Practicioners, we want to respect each group autonomy while coordinating. We may need to clarify what falls under whose responsibility.

### Solid Practicioners election - co-chairs and ODI AC rep

https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners/issues/16#issuecomment-2829339384

* eP: All 3 candidates - Jeff, Michal and Rahul became practicioners co-chairs. Jeff will represent practicioners at ODI AC


### Data domains: contacts and calendars

https://github.com/solid/contacts
https://github.com/solid/webid-profile
https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners/discussions/10#discussioncomment-9014767

* eP: suggestion to prioritize work, including aligning contact information in address book and discoverabel from person/organization WebID
* HZ: ... echanging keys over QR codes. It is related to at least contacts and WebID profiles. Would you like a demo.
* eP: there is also possibility to ask practicioners if they would like to see a demo
* HZ: It is like a vcard, you can have whatever you want in that card. We talked about having support for solid storage. It would be interesting to talk to Sebastien from ActivityPods. If we have multiple implementations supporting Solid it would be good.
* eP: of the main focuses of the CG should be data domains. They are more vertical domains, like ERP, but there are horizontal domains, like contacts and calendars. 
* ... There are many details, events, contacts. There is a small number of shapes. We could try to prototype. There was a project during the mini-hackathon Jackson organized. There are use cases for indexing, pagination, etc.
* HZ: It is complex subject, the problem is adoption. In relation of performance, Solid is not build for performance and it shuldn't be. People try to get benefits from Solid which they are never going to get. Even with databases, people came up with technologies for indexing. I don't think those should be part of Solid. I don't think we will be successfull if we try to have Solid deal with it. 
* MH: I'm using Solid myself, I see two separate versions of Solid emerging. One is using Linked Data, another taking possesion of data objects and storing it in your store. I think you don't have control of data if you don't have custody of it. I see separation of one camp who links the data and another that stores that data.
* HZ: I heard a shocking statement at IIW (internet identity workshop). Mostly people from EU and NA, some also from Asia. People were saying that we are too early with Solid. It was suggested that we need 3 or 4 things for self soverign systems. If you can't prove your identity, due to issuer of identity blocking you it's game over.
* ...: The 2rd component is storage, if they cut access to your data you loose it. I need to prove my identity and own my data. The 3rd component is messaging, if I can't communicate it is again game over.
* ...: There is also running algorithms. There is a big limitations of what I can do. The battles in the identity space is not over. There are sophisticated discussions in identity space. Whatever solution is adopted for identity, if storage and messaging doesn't support that, they will not be successful.
* ...: In our work we need to be able to support those identity systems.
* eP: I joined one of the EU groups, I have the impression that if we don't engage with this groups it will not help. We should engage more, crosspolinate and present reports on what happens in other groups.
* ... Solid is more like generic servers, smart clients. The algorithms that can run on your data, that logic belongs to the client.
* HZ: Personally I disaprove. From my experience, this doesn't scale. I had this converstation with Tim a couple of times. In my experience a lot of it would need to go into infrastructure. I tried to had this conversation in LWS. You will never have performance if you put a burden on the client, especially if it runs in the browser. 
* eP: ...
* HZ: For some reason we don't show examples of that.
* MH: When I socialize Solid. People say there are not many examples out there. 3 reasons to do something are: make money, save money and stay out of trouble. That's how things get real world traction and get adopted. I would like to see more real world use cases. 
* ...: Solid is the only framwork that allows user to have custody of their data. In certain industry domains, having this control is significant. In health casre, research and drug discovery. We try to give patients parity with payers and providers. Currently there is imbalance where patients have no power. We want to solve that.
* HZ: It is not only payers and providers. HC providers are bound by what the administration imposes them to do. If you are provider that moves between hospitals you may need to learn a new ???.
* MH: Currently the state of patient data is scattered over all different platforms. If you want to unify it, where do you put it? Often those are a big piecies of data which don't move easily.
* HZ: How do you see those examples of how Solid works?
* MH: Providers must honor patient request for data. They need to use harmonized format of data FIHR. There's also imaging and video standard ???
* ...: ...
* HZ: Do you know of any work group which tries to align FIHR with solid?
* eP: Eric, WG co-chair worked with it AFAIK
* HZ: I believe he needed to implement his own Solid Server.
