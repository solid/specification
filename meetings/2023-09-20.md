## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Special Topic Meetings
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/555

* SC: A couple of items may need a date.
* SC: "Security flaws in OIDC spec" still seems important. RH was/is? engaged w/ eP, HS. Why isn't this topic more up-front and centre in issues/chats?


### Solid Ecosystem Monitor
URL: https://github.com/virginiaBalseiro/solid-ecosystem-monitor/

* SC: Now includes data/charts for Present and Scribes (due to popular demand) from minutes.

### Solid Protocol Version 0.11.0
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/milestone/7

### CG Chair Election
URL: https://www.w3.org/community/solid/charter/#chairs

* SC: Am looking into tooling. Trying to get support from W3C first. There are third-party tools/services but prefer to use W3C infra for simplicity and verification.
* SC: Please contribute to [Self-Review Questionnaire for Chair Candidates](https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/568). Mentioned at TPAC in [Chartering at W3C breakout session](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2023-breakouts/issues/43) ([minutes](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/13-w3process-minutes.html)), and it was well received towards WG chair selection considerations.
