## Topics

### Special Topic Meetings
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/555

* SC: Please propose special topic meetings in chat or CG weekly call. We can update the announcement board.


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: Please share any implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.


### Rename 'Server' to something more specific â€” 'Resource Server' or 'Storage Server' or ...
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/548

* WT: On a slightly more general note: I started a document comparing the shared definitions of all current reports. Can we have that as an organic definition document to refer to? Will create a PR (where?).


### Return ETag headers on PUT requests
https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues/632

* SC: Let's have additional eyes/minds on this. Cases in which the ETag header can(not) be used in `PUT` and `PATCH` responses. Potentially introduce a requirement or add advisory in Solid Protocol.
* WT: What is the added value for the Solid ecosystem, on top of the affordances already provided by HTTP?
