### JSON-LD Context URI
* SC: Noting that published Solid-OIDC JSON-LD context is [`https://www.w3.org/ns/solid-oidc-context.jsonld`](https://www.w3.org/ns/solid-oidc-context.jsonld)
* SC: Proposed (not yet published) Solid Notifications Protocol JSON-LD context is: [`https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1`](https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1).
* SC: Should we set a URI template for all JSON-LD context URIs or leave it open to specifications to use a template of their choice?
* SC: `notification/v1` is similar to `vc/v1` and `credentials/v2`.
