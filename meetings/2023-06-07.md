## Topics

### Add 2023-05-25 agenda and minutes
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/527

* SC: No minutes are provided, and if the meeting was informal, I suggest closing this as meeting cancelled.
* eP: What does informal mean? No proposals or resolutions during the meeting, we discussed
* SC: Since there are no minutes, there is nothing captured. If you want to make a suggestion to PR saying which topics were discussed and who was present, we can merge. Minutes should help those who cannot attend.
* eP: We can close. Follow up will be in issues. Topics were [Issue #525](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/525) and JSON-LD context for Solid Notifications. 

ACTION: SC to close.


### W3C TPAC 2023
URL: https://www.w3.org/2023/09/TPAC/

* SC: Will anyone be in person at TPAC 2023?
* SC: WIP [TPAC 2023 - Group schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tj66Ase5tc--S-Vjo9Q1pXEINaTmOEzDpnS1J5gtqOI) is posted. Solid CG is on row 70 in the spreadsheet.


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback or interest to implement. Links to products/projects and demos welcome.

### HTTPSig Auth Demo

* LD: What' the status of HttpSig specification?
* HS: HTTP Signatures in IETF. Last call was in September. HTTPSig is a lot more Solid now.
* HS: Written in Scala that compiles to JavaScript.
* LD: Is it for any authenticated agent? ACLs working for keyid? See it working with WebID?
* HS: It is declared logically. Could still use OIDC, because `401` can come back to use that. Can use passwords too. The client should have ??? the wallet that I'm writing. It should be able to select which of these descriptions fits for authentication needs.
* TBL: Good demo. I suppose ??? How much would it take to config option for CSS to use it? You got Scala→JavaScript. CSS needs JS. Is there a test suite?
* HS: A lot of tests for HTTPSig. This is the beginning of the test — the data I should be getting back... If you send me someone that's a JavaScript developer to help me to help them (???), we can find the right people. I don't know CSS that well. I know people that would know how to bridge that gap to do it. I'd be happy with more people using and maintaining.
* TBL: How many lines of code is this? Implementation code to convert to JavaScript.
* HS: ??? allows you to easily make an API, call code directly from ??? 
* SC: One of the most important things for this group is how HTTPSig specification advances. Will you be dedicating time to continue work on it? Important for implementations to use most current.
* HS: I now have an implementation and experience. Definitely want to finish this now. I have a milestone to do that.
* SC: Feel free to bring updates on HTTPSig to the group.
* TBL: Hopefully the WAC files shouldn't change, e.g., Groups. The modes like RWA. Useful for making this change, the way you make authenticate, and we can plug in HTTPSigs and keep everything else the same.
* eP: often the user and app have their own WebID, and client has client ID. Each WebID has its own possible keys. In your case, is the private key the client's or the user's?
* HS: working on a project called Solid Wallet. The idea is to have a ??? which would be secured. The way it works is you can have your keys on your pod, protected so only the wallet can access them, keep them in a safe place, and sign requests on your behalf. It could also be a proxy on your pod that does that.  


### Compatibility with existing implementations
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/31

* SC: Any objections to keeping the paragraph in?
* SC: No objections.

ACTION: SC to close the issue and reflect group consensus. 

### Revise scope and out-of-scope
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/38

* SC: Resolves https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/9
* SC: We have some agreement in the PR but there's a bit of paraphrasing we need to be careful with. I do want to wrap up the PR, but if we can try to integrate changes that would clarify. Any objections to merging this PR? 
* ML: PAC wanted to answer but not sure if he did. 
* SC: It is assigned to PAC. If we have agreement, we would allow him to have last review and merge. 
* SC: We can drop the word "new". We might have an exception with WebID. If it's listed as a deliverable, it is not intended to conflict with out of scope. 
* SC: No objections.

ACTION: SC to integrate change from discussion on PR with eP. PAC to have last review and merge.


### Consider adopting WebID 1.0 ED as a Deliverable
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/39

* SC: The proposal is to adopt WebID as a deliverable. We had several approvals from the CG perspective. At least one approval from WebID CG perspective. The specification is quite integral to Solid, been around for a long time, used by several communities outside Solid. It is mature. Things need to be improved, but it was deemed to be mature enough for Solid ecosystem to use widely. Lots of our specs and implementations use it. It is something we depend on. With respect to normative references, it would be in Solid WG's interest to run it through Recommendation Track.
* SC: We need agreement that we want to take it on and no objections from WebID CG.
* JZ: Presumably this would ease the work of the Solid WebID-Profile group because we'd have something that is already on track to be accepted in the WebID spec itself. Is that correct?
* SC: Yes.
* JZ: Then I'm in favor. 
* LD: This would mean we adopt the WebID spec within the WG? This would go beyond the WebID panel? Would also incorporate non-Solid-specific? 
* SC: Yes. It's non-Solid-specific. Solid WebID profile is one of the specs that uses it; other specs also use it (AuthN, etc.).
* LD: Will we be able to maintain the boundary between the general WebID specification and the specific profile being defined for the Solid specification in the context of the Solid WG?
* SC: WebID identity specification is strictly about identity. WebID profile is about data model.  
* eP: +1 to adopt
* TBL: Crucial thing is that if this is something the server needs to understand, it needs to be at same level of maturity as Solid protocol. Things like what's in your WebID profile should not be there because not server's concern. 
* eP: Currently Solid OIDC depends on it because it specifies the issuer must be specified in the WebID document. WebID spec is lightweight. Only has two requirements. 
* SC: Objections to adding WebID spec as deliverable to the charter?
* HS: No objections from me.
* SC: HS, can you run it through WebID CG to see if there are objections to handing off the work to the Solid WG if the WG happens? The work could later be passed back to the WebID CG. 


### Strategy for normative references
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/37
* SC: On W3C to give us go-ahead on what's necessary. Let's come back to it. 

### Update mission
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/7

* SC: This is editorial. PRs welcome.
