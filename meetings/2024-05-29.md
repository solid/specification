* VB: We should consider potential conflicts with other meetings people want to attend; see draft schedule: https://www.w3.org/2024/05/tpac2024-schedule-20240523.html
* VB: Duration is 90 minutes to 2 hours. 
* VB: We also have the option of having a joint meeting with another group if we wish. 
* VB: We need to provide an approximate number of in-person attendees. Who will be attending?
* MdJ: Is anybody going in person?
* VB: Yes, I need information if someone is going in person. The aproximate number. 
* AC: I may go; too far out for me to know.
* TBL: I don't plan to go. I will be going to IETF meeting in Canada.
* MdJ: If there is nobody going, there is no reason to have a meeting.
* TBL: We could schedule introduction to solid for other people.
* HZ: There may be high attendance but it is hard to plan. Last time the room was full.
* VB: We need to provide a tentative number of attendees. So far, it seems like no-one is going.
* HZ: We should schedule a meeting
* VB: How do we agree on time? Should we use a poll?
* MdJ: If no one is going, it may not matter.
* VB: Yes, it does matter for people who want to join online. Also conflicts with other meetings people might want to join.
* HZ: Being west coast, there is a big time difference
* AC: You will have higher attendance if it is early in the week. On Friday, many peole have already left.
* eP: I think we need to first find out who is going in person; then they can take responsibility of setting everything up.
* VB: We can ask PAC if he plans to go. Should we try to pick a time, Tue 9am maybe?
* RG: For India, the timezone diff is even worse.

ACTION: VB to respond to request with earliest time on Tuesday. 

* PAC: will join soon, but my previous meeting is taking longer than expected, sorry.
* eP: Survey for FedCM, they might be interested in joining or having a joint meeting.
* MdJ: Aaron Parecki made [IndieWeb tutorial for IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/FedCM_for_IndieAuth)

ACTION: eP to get in touch with FedCM and see if they want a joint meeting at TPAC. 

* PAC: I'm going to TPAC and have a number of WGs meeting to attend. I would like to meet with Solid CG given no time conflicts.


### CG-DRAFT PRs

* [Add TR/2024/protocol-20240512](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/651) for Solid Protocol CG-DRAFT 0.11.0.
* [Add TR/2024/wac-20250512](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/652) for WAC CG-DRAFT 1.0.0.
* [Add TR/2024/notifications-protocol-20240512](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/654) for Solid Notifications Protocol CG-DRAFT v0.3.0.
* [Update ED/qa](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/655) for CG-DRAFT v0.3.0.
* [Update webid-profile](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/pull/117) for CG-DRAFT v1.0.0.
* SC: Please see PROPOSALs 1-2 in some of those comments, essentially about synching with editorial changes before publishing, with some exceptions like [PR 660](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/660) (see next topic) for [PR 651](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/651). It shouldn't be seen as a blocker for releasing Solid Protocol CG-DRAFT though.
* VB: most [open PRs](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls/) have no objections, expect one on WebID Profile. [PR 660](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/660) needs more reviews. 

### Clarify requests including content; container creation; omit slug targetting auxiliary
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/660

* SC: I think this should be released with CG-DRAFT v0.11.0. Please review.
* RG: Sarven and I are still discussion various details, it may be good to review it after we find initial agreement.
* VB: People can already contribute to the conversation

### WebID Profile spec
* eP: Some parts touching on oidc should be defined whether it will go to WG or not. 
* VB: Not going to WG. 
* eP: Common reqs about protecting sensitive issues. We should have a STM about these topics. 
* eP: I'm writing an extension for CSS to create WebID documents outside of storage
* https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/16/views/2?pane=issue&itemId=65170443

### i18n and n11n of resource identifiers
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/575

* VB: Calling for implementation feedback as it helps with incubation; please link to your implementation.
* VB: Postpone until we have more implementation feedback and/or WT / SC in the call. 


### Informal objection to reclassifying CG documents
* RG: Looking at [W3C definition](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#reports) for different kinds of documents. Looks at odds with what Ian told us two weeks ago. {reads definitions}
* RG: Says document is produced by a W3C group, not a CG or WG. CG report is an end product produced by CG/BG. Means it has received patent agreement but is not final. Calling the product we are iterating on a "community report" is different from what we are doing. We should call it a draft CG report. 
* RG: He suggested to remove W3C branding from our documents. This removal of branding is just because only W3C WG ??? 
* MdJ: CG cannot pretend that what they produced was produced by the W3C. 
* RG: WG cannot pretend that either. W3C does not endorse WG EDs.
* MdJ: Big difference between what CGs and WGs can do. 
* eP: {shows screen}
* eP: Is the problem with "Editor's Draft" ("ED")? 
* RG: I disagree with changing ED to CG-DRAFT because we are not doing a final report. 
* eP: What is it not matching? Is it the Editor's Draft?
* RG: Solid protocol should be an editor's draft, not a CG-DRAFT. 
* PAC: I agree the text says ED can be produced by any group. ED template is a recommendation, has W3C logo and everything. That's what Ian wanted to avoid. Patent licensing commitment is agreed by any W3C CG participant. There is nothing special to do to publish a CG-DRAFT. Solid CG is special because documents were produced by the CG. We have some automatic controls when people make a contribution while not a member. Solid CG does not have this. It might be questioned whether tcontributions are coming from outside the CG, which is why Ian recommended to use either. On a daily basis, we call it an ED, because it's the last version pushed. It's supposed to work that way. 
* RG: I mostly agree, but if it's in-between version numbers, is that ED or CG-DRAFT?
* PAC: That can be a CG-DRAFT report. Any intermediate version can be a CG-DRAFT. 
* eP: Solid CG is not doing things like normal CGs. Is there anything we can do to become a normal CG? 
* PAC: That's where my legal knowledge reaches its limits. This was one of the things Ian mentioned. Reaching out to old known contributors; checking that they are members of the CG; if they are not, reaching out and getting them to join the CG...
* MdJ: If they were member while contributing, it also counts. Some people left CG after contributing.
* VB: You mentioned that there could be some automations. They would require GitHub account to be connected to W3C account.
* PAC: One can register GitHub accounts in their W3C account; not sure if we can use W3C bots in solid org.
* VB: That's something we could look into. 
* eP: Can we figure out if we can use those bots? 
* PAC: I will ask. 

ACTION: PAC to ask about automation tools for checking PRs are coming from CG members. 

### Add advisement property and class
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/91

* SC: Solid QA related. And perhaps also of general interest to folks interested in Linked Data stuff.

### IETF plans for Vancouver or Dublin
* TBL: Who is going to IETF?
* MdJ: I plan to go to the Dublin one. 
* RG: I haven't planned. If I get funding, I might consider Dublin. 
* TBL: Maybe we should organize a BoF on Solid.
* RG: Have you considered putting a proposal to ??? 

### repo name / URL change, "Security Best Practices" -> "Security Considerations" 

* VB: We decided to change the title. Should we change the repo name as well?
* eP: solid/security-considerations
* PAC: Repo renaming automatically sets up GH repo redirection, but not between github pages
