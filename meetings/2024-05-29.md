* [Add TR/2024/wac-20250512](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/652) for WAC CG-DRAFT 1.0.0.

* SC: Please see PROPOSALs 1-2 in some of those comments, essentially about synching with editorial changes, with some exceptions like [PR 660](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/660) (see next topic) for [PR 651](https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/651). It shouldn't be seen as a blocker for releasing Solid Protocol CG-DRAFT though.
