### Structure of ecosystem document and related specifications

TIMBL: Core protocol should include authentication, authorization, identity - Solid Protocol is client/server protocol
    - Also doesn't include account management

JB: Propose to rename current ecosystem document to solid protocol since that it was it encapsulates [AGREED]
    
JB: Where should documents be published to?

TIMBL: Propose to publish to solidproject.org under /TR
    - JB - Will take the action
    - https://solidproject.org/TR/ecosystem
