## Topics

### discussion#555 should be made to look like it's no longer active, with more blatant link to current "project"16
URL: github.com/solid/specification/issues/635

* VB: Related: https://github.com/w3c-cg/solid/issues/20

### Meeting Minutes

* VB: We've operating with the understanding that the minutes are available relatively soon after the meeting (for several years in fact). [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/w3c-cg/solid/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#decisions) indicates that expectation to merge "within 2 days." Do we need to change this expectation to 1 month? 
* VB: If there is an issue with the pipeline we are currently using, the alternative to use W3C infrastructure could allow us to publish minutes immediately after the call: https://github.com/w3c-cg/solid/issues/18 .


### WG Charter Proposal

#### Name suggestions for the proposed working group
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/73

* VB: PAC, 1) is this sample sufficient for the poll? 2) poll now or another week? 3) will you follow-up reach out to any particular W3C group/team for the poll?

#### Charter should limit the scope of idenity to HTTP based identifiers
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/70

* VB: PAC, should that issue be marked as duplicate of [Consider marking DID out of scope](https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/54) ? Additional feedback needed? Should the commenter be present in a CG call in order to further process this or can we close?

#### Consider marking DID out of scope
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/54

* VB: PAC, any status update on this?

#### What are the Solid User Stories?
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/issues/67

* VB: Is this issue relevant for the charter proposal and should be left for discussion elsewhere? Does https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/69#discussion_r1522954948 partly address this concern?

#### Tantek's feedback re 2 / 3 chairs
