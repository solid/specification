### GitHub Discussions

* SC: Thanks to eP for suggesting to enable GitHub Discussions. It should help us to better record and organise... discussions / "institutional" knowledge. Discussions, Issues/PRs and other features are well integrated. Off the shelf categories: announcements, general, ideas, polls, q&a, show and tell, but they can be modified.
* SC: Any (general) feedback? We can refer to Discussions from the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Solid Demos
* SC: Following https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-07-19.md#solid-demos
* SC: There is a "Call for Group updates and Technical Demos (videos)" at TPAC2023. It is suggested that we can showcase the work done in the Solid CG by creating a short video to be published on the TPAC2023 website. Videos are due by 2023-08-30. More details to follow but there is https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2023/Demos_and_Group_updates#Best_Practices_for_Recording_Videos .
* SC: We have two separate cases to communicate/demo: 1) general CG work, and 2) specific use cases or interests.
* SC: For the time being, I suggest everyone self-publish their screencasts, and share the URLs with the CG. These are good assets. We can find a home to refer to those links. More details to follow; for instance, make sure the URL is publicly archivable by the Internet Archive.

### Return ETag headers on PUT requests
https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues/632

* SC: Let's have additional pair of eyes/minds on this. Cases in which the ETag header can(not) be used in PUT and PATCH responses. Potentially introduce a requirement or add advisory in Solid Protocol.
