### Status of the WG
* PAC: I'm having conversation with ??? The next step is to submit a new charter. The horizontal review should be relatively fast. Then we will have votes of AC. If we still have formal objections, we should go ASAP to the new council. Many objections have been addressed; some objections can be argued in front of the council.
* HZ: I recall that Sarven was considering only one objection valid. It was related to the chair selection. There was also something about the scope and the explainer. Tim has already written an explainer. What exactly has to be rewritten?
* PAC: Open PRs already cover what needs to be covered. There were concerns about us trying to have the current spec rubber stamped. Someone noted that Solid was mentioned 15 times. We should have been more careful about that. The final Solid specification can be different than current Solid.
* AC: The term "Solid" has been a point of objection. I think Solid is important for branding, but less important on the spec level. To what extent can we remove the use of the term "Solid"? This could involve the name of the group. That should address a lot of concerns about rubber stamping.
* PAC: +1, the only problem is coming up with another name. I'm considering this option as well.
* PAC: we can also clarify what "Solid" means. From process perspective, more neutrality could help.
* RG: Solid defines three bullet points that it tries to accomplish. Can we state those points? We should be more precise with the language.
* eP: Does the charter include use cases & requirements? That could help clarify goals of Solid.
* PAC: I noticed that we don't mention the UCR document. It is common to have one as a WG Note. Charter refers to the use cases repo.

### Solid World
* on track for 2024/02/27
* (JZ asked if the time of the CG meeting could be adjusted so PST folks could attend)
* HZ: it was announced last week, it will focus on the Practicioners group. There are four speakers ...
* eP: We can make online polls for cg weekly and stm
* AC: Some groups have rotating schedule, this can be also considered.
* RG: The problem with Wednesdays is that there are two other meetings afterwards. If we push it two hours ahead this will confilict with other meetings.
* TBL: SolidOS meets after this meeting

### Recommend predicate for a literal media type (Content-Type)
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/537
