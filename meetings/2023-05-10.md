* SC: Suggestions and commitments welcome.


### Solid QA
URL: https://solidproject.org/ED/qa

* SC: We need to advance Solid QA, including all the related work (e.g., test suite development, tests). It is at the heart of TRs - "gives Solid projects confidence that their software is compatible with other implementations." So, please contribute to the development. Advancing TRs and QA work go together. This is the required ground work in order to inform about the level of adoption of TRs.

### Clarify normative, tentative, new Deliverables
URL: https://github.com/solid/solid-wg-charter/pull/28

>* PA: Yes, I will review this PR and try to get feedback from other W3C people about how to address this. I like the idea to list them as other "adopted" drafts; however, this might indicate a stronger commitment.


### Scope needs to be tightly defined with narrow focus
