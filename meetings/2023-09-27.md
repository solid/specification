## Topics

### Joint meeting with WebAgentsCG

* SC: Great. Minutes at https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2023-09-26.md (in a few hours).
* SC: Let's make sure to collaborate with them as we have shared interests. WebAgents concretely opens up / expands a space for Solid.


### CG Chairs Election
URL: https://www.w3.org/community/solid/charter/#chairs

* SC: I was looking into election tooling. After some digging with W3C, good news! The W3C questionnaire service is available to us! Requested that W3C staff to act as independent / third-party to verify the results using STV. They suppose it'd be possible but waiting for confirmation. We can get going after this! Will send out an announcement for next steps.
* SC: In the meantime, please update your affiliations on W3C account.
* SC: Please contribute to [Self-Review Questionnaire for Chair Candidates](https://github.com/solid/specification/discussions/568).
