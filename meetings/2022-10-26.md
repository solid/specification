#### Authorization focused meetings
URL: https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/325

* SC: Revisit Work Items to see what needs updating. Here is one:


#### Update authorization-ucr's editors
URL: https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/309

### URI persistence, ownership, and representation management
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/462

* SC: Would like to get a sense. Where to draw the line (for now). High-level view.
* SC: Certainly technically possible. This particular discussion is not about how.


### Client Errors

* SC: This is related to Constraints and Problem Details: https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol#constraints-problem-details

#### Add Inbox Discovery on Client Error
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/253

* SC: This has a long history / grounded on issues and implementation experience going back 2017 (if not much earlier).

URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/28



### Use IRIs for resource identification
URL: https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/347

### Social profile as discovery mechanism

* VB: Is profile data different from other data and should it be discoverable in one particular resource?
