### Add TR/2022/protocol-20221231

### Index and Registry
* SC: In order to document collections of values or other data that TRs use, a separate document can be published. For example, https://solidproject.org/TR/notifications-protocol refers to https://solidproject.org/TR/notification-subscription-types (Living Document) where an index of subscription types can be found.
* SC: To date, the index document only listed documents published under `TR/`.
* SC: The notifications-panel also has https://github.com/solid/notifications/blob/main/README.md#subscription-types that lists all types.
* SC: Question. Would it be simpler to re-use https://solidproject.org/TR/ as the index for auxiliary documents, e.g., notification channel types, since it is intended to list all of the CG's Work Items. The "Indexing Procedure" can be part of TRs that need it.
