# Solid Specifications

This repository contains the source code for the work on [Solid Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/) (TR) of the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) (CG) to fulfill the requirements of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The CG operates under a [Charter](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/charter/).

The Technical Reports (TRs) encompass specifications, use cases and requirements, best practices and guidelines, primers, and notes about the Solid ecosystem. The CG's Work Items are linked from the TR homepage.

The Solid Protocol is accessible from the following URLs:
* Latest version: https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol
* Persistent version 0.10.0: https://solidproject.org/TR/2022/protocol-20221231
* Editor's draft: https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol
