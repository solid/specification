# Solid specifications

This repository contains the source code of the work on [Solid Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/) (TR) of the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) (CG) to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The TRs include specifications, use cases and requirements, best practices and guidelines, primers and notes about the Solid ecosystem. The CG's Work Items are linked from the TR homepage.

The Solid Protocol is available from the following URLs:
* Latest version: https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol
* Persistent version 0.9.0: https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217
* Editor's draft: https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol
