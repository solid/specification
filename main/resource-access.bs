Authenticated Resource Access {#resource-access}
================================================

Issue: Write introduction to the Authenticated Resource Access section.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol ## {#http}

### Background and Need ### {#http-need}
<em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Solid clients and servers need to exchange data securely over the Internet,
and they do so using the Web protocol HTTP.
This section describes in detail
which parts of HTTP must be implemented by clients and servers.

### Required server-side implementation ### {#http-server}

A [=data pod=] MUST be an HTTP/1.1 server [[!RFC7230]][[!RFC7231]].
It SHOULD additionally be an HTTP/2 server [[!RFC7540]]
to improve performance,
especially in cases where individual clients
are expected to send high numbers of successive requests.

A data pod SHOULD use the `https` URI scheme
in order to secure the connection between clients and servers.
When both `http` and `https` are supported,
all `http` URIs MUST redirect to their `https` counterparts
using a response with a `301` status code and a `Location` header.

A data pod MUST implement the server part
of HTTP/1.1 Conditional Requests [[!RFC7232]]
to ensure that updates requested by clients
will only be applied if given preconditions are met.
It SHOULD additionally implement the server part
of HTTP/1.1 Caching [[!RFC7234]]
to reduce bandwidth.
A data pod MAY implement the server part
of HTTP/1.1 Range Requests [[!RFC7233]]
on large representations
to achieve further bandwidth reduction.

A data pod MUST implement the server part
of HTTP/1.1 Authentication [[!RFC7235]].
When a client does not provide valid credentials
when requesting a resource that requires it (see [[#webid]]),
the data pod MUST send a response with a `401` status code
(unless `404` is preferred for security reasons).


## Linked Data Platform ## {#ldp}

Issue: Write Linked Data Platform section.

Draft:
A Solid data pod MUST conform to the LDP specification [[!LDP]].


## WebID ## {#webid}

Issue: Explain inline that agents accessing non-public Solid resources
  need to authenticate with a WebID, which is a URL
  pointing to a document with an RDF representation.


### WebID-OIDC ### {#webid-oidc}

Issue: Write WebID-OIDC section.

Draft:
A Solid data pod MUST conform to the WebID-OIDC specification [[!WEBID-OIDC]].


### WebID-TLS ### {#webid-tls}

Issue: Write WebID-TLS section.

Draft:
A Solid data pod MAY conform to the WebID-TLS specification [[!WEBID-TLS]].


## Web Access Control ## {#wac}

Issue: Write Web Access Control section.

Draft:
A Solid data pod MUST conform to the Web Access Control specification [[!WAC]].


## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ## {#cors}

Issue: Write Cross-Origin Resource Sharing section.

Draft:
A Solid data pod MUST conform to the CORS specification [[!FETCH]].
