## Web Access Control ## {#web-access-control}

Web Access Control (<abbr title="Web Access Control">WAC</abbr>) is a
decentralized cross-domain access control system. The WAC mechanism is
concerned with giving access to agents denoted by a [[#webid]] to perform
various kinds of read-write operations on resources identified by URLs. The
<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">Access Control List</a></cite>
(<abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr>) ontology is used to describe
authorization policies about authorized agents with modes of access on target
resources.

Servers MUST conform to the Web Access Control specification [[!WAC]].

A resource can advertise an ACL document that is directly associated by using
the HTTP `Link` header with a `rel` value of `acl` [[#acl]].

In the event that a server can't apply an ACL to a resource, it MUST deny
access.

Servers exposing client's access privileges on a resource URL MUST advertise
by including the `WAC-Allow` HTTP header in the response of HTTP `HEAD` and
`GET` requests.

The syntax for the `WAC-Allow` header, using the ABNF syntax defined in
Section 1.2 of [[!RFC7231]], is:

```
wac-allow           = "WAC-Allow" ":" OWS #access-param OWS
access-param        = permission-group OWS "=" OWS quoted-access-modes
permission-group    = 1*ALPHA
quoted-access-modes = DQUOTE OWS *1(access-mode *(RWS access-mode)) OWS DQUOTE
access-mode         = "read" / "write" / "append" / "control"
```

The `WAC-Allow` HTTP header's field-value is a comma-separated list of
`access-param`s. `access-param` is a whitespace-separated list of `access
mode`s granted to a `permission-group`.

This specification defines the following `permission-group`s:

<dl>
  <dt>`user`</dt>
  <dd>Permissions granted to the agent requesting the resource.</dd>
  <dt>`public`</dt>
  <dd>Permissions granted to the public.</dd>
</dl>

`access-mode` corresponds to the modes of access as defined in the
ACL ontology (`acl:Read`, `acl:Write`, `acl:Append`, `acl:Control`).

Clients can discover access privileges on a resource by making an HTTP `HEAD`
or `GET` request on the target URL, and checking the `WAC-Allow` header value
for access parameters listing the allowed access modes per permission group.

Clients' parsing algorithm for the `WAC-Allow` header should incorporate error
handling. When the received message fails to match an allowed pattern, finds 
unrecognised access parameters or access modes, clients MUST ignore the
received `WAC-Allow` header-field.
